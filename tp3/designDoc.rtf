\f0\fs24 \cf0 My project is Aesthetics.io, which is a replica (not really) of the existing game MMO game, Agar.io. The game has an extremely addicting, yet simple, gameplay that attracts millions of users online. Today, the online gaming is becoming harder and harder to learn due to the game makers\'92 ambitions to make a game original. As a result, more and more older generations and young generations are avoiding these fun games available online. Aesthetics.io, with its simple gameplay, attracts users of any age, creating unpredictable game outcome. I have made some few changes to the original game.  It is single player and it has AI that is quite hard to beat so I had to balance its speed and numbers. \

Aesthetics.io improves on the current Agar.io in both the aesthetics and smoothness of the game, using pygame instead of node.js.}
